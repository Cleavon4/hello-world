# hello-world

I am beginning the journey to what I deserve.

I have been an entertainment producer and vision consultant for about ten years now. 
I am posturing myself to learn new skills that will take my visions and I further. 
I hope to collaborate with other creators and work for/with thriving corporations that welcome my creative prowess.
I am Cleavon Meabon, IV.

In the last commit, I introduced myself and my mission in 4 lines.
